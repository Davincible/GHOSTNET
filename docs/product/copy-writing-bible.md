## 1. Brand Voice & Tone

### The GHOSTNET Voice

**We sound like:** A cool hacker friend who found a way to make money and is letting you in on it. Confident but not arrogant. Exciting but not desperate. Dangerous but not reckless.

**We DON'T sound like:** A corporate press release. A desperate shill. A financial advisor. A scammer promising guaranteed returns.

### Tone Guidelines

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Announcements | Confident, exciting | "The network is live. Time to jack in." |
| Explanations | Clear, cool | "Here's how it works. No BS." |
| Hype moments | Electric, urgent | "BLACK ICE just paid out 47x. Who's next?" |
| Risk warnings | Direct, honest | "This is high-risk. Only play what you can lose." |
| Community | Inclusive, tribal | "Welcome to the network, ghost." |

### Key Language Rules

**DO use:**
- "Jack in" (not "deposit" or "stake")
- "Ghost" (survived), "Traced" (died)
- "The network" (not "the protocol")
- "Operators" or "Ghosts" (not "users")
- "Extract" (not "withdraw")
- "$DATA" (always with $)

**DON'T use:**
- "Invest" (we're a game)
- "Guaranteed" (nothing is)
- "Safe" (it's not)
- "Passive income" (too scammy)
- "To the moon" (overused)

### The GHOSTNET Vocabulary

```
GHOSTNET DICTIONARY:
────────────────────

Jack In = Deposit/stake
Extract = Withdraw
Ghost = Survived a scan
Traced = Died/liquidated
Operator = Player/user
The Feed = Live activity stream
Trace Scan = Death roll event
Ghost Streak = Consecutive survivals
The Cascade = Redistribution system
The Furnace = Burn mechanism
Black Ice = Highest risk level
The Vault = Safest level
Crew = Team/guild
$DATA = The token
```

## 3. Elevator Pitches

### The 10-Second Pitch
```
GHOSTNET is a crypto survival game. Stake tokens, earn yield, but watch out—
periodic "trace scans" can wipe you out. Higher risk = higher rewards. 
The twist? When others die, their stake flows to survivors. It's PvP economics.
```

### The 30-Second Pitch
```
GHOSTNET is a real-time survival game on MegaETH. You "jack in" by staking 
$DATA tokens at different risk levels—from safe (100% APY) to insane (90% 
death rate, infinite upside).

Every few hours, the network runs a "trace scan." Survivors keep earning. 
The traced? Their stake gets redistributed to survivors and partially burned.

The deeper you go, the more you earn—but the higher chance you lose it all.
It's completely passive (stake and forget), but mini-games let active players
reduce their death rate. Liquidity is burned, so we literally can't rug you.

It's the intersection of gambling, gaming, and DeFi. And it's live.
```

### The Technical Pitch (For Devs/VCs)
```
GHOSTNET is a high-frequency game theory protocol on MegaETH exploiting 
sub-millisecond finality for real-time staking games.

Core mechanics: 5-tier risk ladder with probabilistic liquidations via 
Chainlink VRF. Redistribution follows a 60/30/10 split (survivors/burn/protocol).
Dual-deflationary pressure through transaction fees (buyback+burn) and 
trading tax (direct burn).

Sustainability math: Net deflationary above $175k daily volume. Revenue 
model: 10% of liquidations + 1% trading tax + $0.20/transaction to treasury.
Projected $2M+ annual revenue at moderate adoption.

Liquidity is burned at launch—zero rug vector. Team tokens vest over 24 months.
```

### The Degen Pitch
```
5 levels. Level 1 is safe. Level 5 has 90% death rate but unlimited upside.

Every time someone dies, 30% of their stack goes to survivors. 30% is burned forever.

The more people playing below you, the more you earn. The fewer people in your 
level, the bigger your share when someone dies.

Liquidity is burned. Can't rug. Either you make it or you don't.

You jacking in or what?
```

## 4. Twitter/X Copy

### Launch Thread (Thread 1)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
```
GHOSTNET is live.

A game where:
• Doing nothing can make you rich
• When others die, you profit
• Liquidity is burned (we can't rug)
• 90% of players in BLACK ICE will lose everything

Still want in?

Here's how it works 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
The concept is simple:

1. Jack in (stake $DATA)
2. Choose your risk level
3. Earn yield while you're in
4. Survive the "trace scans"
5. Extract your gains

But here's the twist...
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Every few hours, the network runs a trace scan.

If you get traced → You lose your stake
If you survive → You keep earning AND get a cut of the dead

It's PvP economics. When they die, you eat.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
There are 5 levels:

THE VAULT → 0% death, 100-500% APY
MAINFRAME → 2% death, 1,000% APY
SUBNET → 15% death, 5,000% APY
DARKNET → 40% death, 20,000% APY
BLACK ICE → 90% death, unlimited upside

Choose your risk.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
"But anon, isn't this a ponzi?"

No. Here's why:

• 30% of every death is BURNED (not redistributed)
• Yield comes from deaths below you, not new money
• The system works with flat or declining users
• We can't print tokens to pay yield

Math > vibes.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
"Can the devs rug?"

Literally impossible.

• Liquidity is BURNED at launch
• We cannot withdraw LP tokens
• They don't exist anymore
• Team tokens vest over 24 months

Check the contracts yourself.
```

**Tweet 7:**
```
The best part?

You don't even have to play.

Stake in THE VAULT. Close your browser. Come back whenever.

Or play mini-games to reduce your death rate:
• Typing challenges
• Hack runs
• Prediction markets

Passive or active. Your call.
```

**Tweet 8:**
```
The feed is what makes it addictive.

Real-time stream of:
• People jacking in
• People getting traced (deaths)
• People extracting gains
• Whale alerts
• Countdown to next scan

You'll watch it for hours. Trust me.
```

**Tweet 9:**
```
Why MegaETH?

Sub-millisecond finality.

When you see someone die in the feed, it JUST happened.
No waiting for blocks. No mempool anxiety.
It feels like a video game, not a blockchain.

Speed is the product.
```

**Tweet 10 (CTA):**
```
The network is live.
The feed is burning.
Operators are jacking in.

The question is: are you brave enough?

🔗 ghostnet.io
📱 @ghostnet_io

Jack in. Don't get traced.

### Standalone Tweets

**Hype Tweets:**
```
Someone just survived BLACK ICE at 92% death rate.

Their stack: 500 $DATA → 1,247 $DATA in 3 hours.

The feed is unhinged right now.
```

```
TRACE SCAN [DARKNET] just hit.

847 operators survived.
153 got traced.

12,400 $DATA redistributed to survivors.
3,720 $DATA burned forever.

The cascade never stops.
```

```
Current GHOSTNET stats:

• 2,847 operators jacked in
• $487,000 TVL
• 127,000 $DATA burned today
• Longest ghost streak: 23

The network grows.
```

```
Someone just jacked into BLACK ICE with 10,000 $DATA.

90% chance they lose it all in 30 minutes.
10% chance they're a legend.

The feed is watching. 👀
```

**Educational Tweets:**
```
How GHOSTNET yields work (simple version):

Level 5 players die → Money flows to Level 4
Level 4 players die → Money flows to Level 3
Level 3 players die → Money flows to Level 2
Level 2 players die → Money flows to Level 1

Degens feed whales. Whales eat safe.
```

```
Why your death rate DECREASES when more people join:

More TVL = network modifier improves
Your 40% base rate becomes 34%
Everyone gets safer together

This is why you want your friends in.
(Also you get referral bonuses but that's separate)
```

```
The 5 ways $DATA burns:

1. 30% of every death
2. $1.80 of every $2 fee (buyback)
3. 9% of every DEX trade
4. 5% of all Dead Pool bets
5. All item purchases

At $175k daily volume = net deflation

The furnace never stops.
```

**Engagement Tweets:**
```
What level are you jacking into?

🏦 THE VAULT (safe, low yield)
💻 MAINFRAME (conservative)
🌐 SUBNET (balanced)
🌑 DARKNET (degen)
🖤 BLACK ICE (psychopath)
```

```
Your ghost streak in GHOSTNET?

0 - Haven't jacked in yet
1-5 - Just getting started
6-10 - Feeling lucky
11-20 - Actually good
20+ - Are you cheating?
```

```
Be honest:

When you see someone get traced in the feed, do you feel:

A) Bad for them
B) Good because you got their money
C) Both
D) Nothing, I'm numb now
```

### "How It Works" Section

HOW IT WORKS
════════════

01 / JACK IN
─────────────
Stake $DATA at your chosen risk level.
Higher risk = higher potential yield.
You can go full degen or play it safe.

02 / EARN YIELD
───────────────
Your position earns yield every second.
The riskier your level, the faster it grows.
Do nothing. Or play mini-games for an edge.

03 / SURVIVE THE SCAN
─────────────────────
Periodic "trace scans" hit each level.
If you're traced, you lose your stake.
If you survive, you keep earning—and get a cut of the dead.

04 / EXTRACT
────────────
Cash out whenever you want.
Or let it ride and watch your stack grow.
Your call, operator.

WHY GHOSTNET?
═════════════

LIQUIDITY IS BURNED
───────────────────
Not locked. BURNED. The LP tokens don't exist anymore.
We literally cannot withdraw them. Ever.
Check the contracts. We're stuck here with you.

DEFLATIONARY BY DESIGN
──────────────────────
30% of every death is burned forever.
9% tax on trades → burned.
Fee revenue → buyback and burn.
The supply only goes down.

PASSIVE OR ACTIVE
─────────────────
Stake and forget. Close your browser. Come back richer (or poorer).
OR play mini-games to reduce your death rate.
Your choice. Both work.

REAL-TIME EVERYTHING
────────────────────
Built on MegaETH. Sub-millisecond finality.
When you see someone die, it just happened.

## 8. Influencer Brief

### Quick Facts (Copy-Paste Ready)
```
GHOSTNET - QUICK FACTS FOR CREATORS
═══════════════════════════════════

What it is:
Real-time survival game on MegaETH where you stake tokens, 
earn yield, and try not to die in periodic "trace scans."

The hook:
When other players die, their stake flows to survivors.
Higher risk = higher rewards (up to 90% death rate).

Key differentiators:
• Liquidity is BURNED (devs can't rug)
• 30% of deaths burned (deflationary)
• 100% passive option (stake and forget)
• Active mini-games for edge (typing, hack runs)
• Real-time feed of all activity

Token: $DATA
Network: MegaETH
Website: ghostnet.io

Talking points to hit:
1. "Liquidity is burned—they can't rug"
2. "When others die, I profit"
3. "90% death rate but infinite upside"
4. "The feed is addictive"

GHOSTNET is a real-time survival game on MegaETH. You stake $DATA tokens at different risk levels, earn yield while you're in, and try to survive periodic "trace scans" that can wipe out your position. When others die, their stake flows to survivors. It's PvP economics meets gambling meets DeFi.
```

### "Is this a ponzi?"
```
No. Here's why:

Traditional ponzis pay existing users with new user money. GHOSTNET pays survivors with dead user money. The difference:

1. 30% of every death is BURNED (removed from existence)
2. The system works even if no new users join
3. Yield comes from risk-takers dying, not from deposits
4. We can't print tokens to pay yield

The math is transparent. Check the docs.
```

### "Can the devs rug?"
```
No. Liquidity is burned at launch.

Not locked. BURNED. The LP tokens are sent to a dead address and don't exist anymore. We cannot withdraw liquidity because there's nothing to withdraw.

Team tokens vest over 24 months with a 1-month cliff.

Check the contract addresses. Verify on-chain. We're stuck here with you.
```

### "What's the minimum to play?"
```
Minimum stakes by level:

• THE VAULT: 100 $DATA
• MAINFRAME: 50 $DATA
• SUBNET: 30 $DATA
• DARKNET: 15 $DATA
• BLACK ICE: 5 $DATA

Start small if you want to learn. BLACK ICE lets you experience the full game for just 5 $DATA.
```

### "How do I reduce my death rate?"
```
Three ways:

1. Play Trace Evasion (typing mini-game) → Up to -25% death rate
2. Complete Hack Runs → Yield multipliers + survival bonuses
3. Join a Crew → Crew bonuses reduce death rates for all members

Active players have significantly better odds than passive ones.
```

### "What happens when I die?"
```
Your staked position is redistributed via "The Cascade":

• 30% goes to survivors in your level
• 30% goes UP to safer levels (as yield)
• 30% is BURNED forever
• 10% goes to the protocol

You don't lose to the devs. You lose to other players and to the burn.
```

## 12. FUD Responses

### "This is just gambling"
```
Yes and no.

It has gambling elements—there's risk and randomness. But unlike pure gambling:

• Skill reduces your death rate (mini-games)
• Strategy matters (level selection, timing)
• Social coordination helps (crews)
• It's transparent (all odds visible)

Think of it as poker vs. slots. There's randomness, but skill matters.

Also: we never claimed it wasn't gambling. We're honest about what this is. High risk. For entertainment. Only play what you can lose.
```

### "The APYs are unsustainable"
```
The APYs come from deaths, not printing.

When someone in DARKNET dies at $20k/year APY, their stake funds everyone else's APY. If no one dies, APY drops. If everyone dies, there's no one left to pay.

The system is self-balancing. High APY = high death rate = high risk. It's priced correctly.

Also: 30% of every death is burned. We're not creating supply to pay yield—we're destroying it.
```

### "Team will dump on us"
```
Team tokens:
• 8% of supply
• 1-month cliff (can't touch until day 30)
• 24-month linear vest (tiny amounts unlock daily)

Even if we wanted to dump, we can't. The vesting contract is immutable.

Also: our revenue comes from the protocol running, not from dumping tokens. We make money when YOU play, not when we exit.
```

### "This will die in a week"
```
Maybe. We're not promising it won't.

But we've designed for longevity:
• Burns create constant buy pressure
• System reset timer creates urgency
• Mini-games create engagement
• Crews create social stickiness
• New features rolling out weekly

We're building fast, adapting faster. If it dies, it won't be because we weren't trying.
```

### "Whale manipulation"
```
Whales are actually good for the network:

1. Big deposits reset the system timer (saves everyone)
2. Whales in THE VAULT absorb yield from below (creates demand)
3. Whale deaths in lower levels = massive cascades (everyone wins)

The game theory aligns whale and small player incentives. When whales do well, everyone does well.

## 14. Community Templates

### Welcome New Members
```
Welcome to the network, ghost 👻

Quick start:
1. Read #rules and #how-to-play
2. Start small (BLACK ICE is only 5 $DATA minimum)
3. Watch the feed before you play
4. Ask questions in #general
5. Find a crew in #lfg

Remember: This is high-risk. Only play what you can afford to lose.

Good luck out there. Don't get traced.
```

### Answering "When Launch?"
```
[If not launched yet]
Soon™. Follow @ghostnet_io for the exact time. Waitlist is open at ghostnet.io.

[If launched]
We're live right now. ghostnet.io. The feed is burning. Come watch.
```

### Answering "Is It Safe?"
```
No. And we never said it was.

GHOSTNET is high-risk by design. BLACK ICE has 90% death rate. Even THE VAULT (0% death rate) is exposed to smart contract risk.

What we CAN say:
• Liquidity is burned (we can't rug)
• Contracts are audited
• Team tokens vest over 24 months

But you can still lose money. Only play what you can afford to lose.
```

### Answering "Price Prediction?"
```
We don't do price predictions. Anyone who tells you they know is lying.

What we can tell you:
• Supply is deflationary (burns > emissions above $175k volume)
• Demand is tied to game activity
• The math is transparent

Do your own research. Make your own decisions. This is not financial advice.
```

### Celebrating Survivals
```
👻 GHOST STATUS CONFIRMED 👻

Another scan survived. Another day in the network.

Keep stacking. Keep surviving. Keep extracting.

The traced feed the living. That's the way.
```

### Consoling Deaths
```
💀 You got traced. It happens.

The network is brutal. Even the best operators get caught.

What now:
• Learn from it (was your level too risky?)
• Start smaller next time
• Play Trace Evasion to improve your odds
• The network will still be here

GGs. See you back in there.

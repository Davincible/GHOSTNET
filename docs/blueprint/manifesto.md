# GHOSTNET

## The Seed

DeFi yield is broken: it's either passive and boring (stake and forget) or active and exhausting (constant management). GHOSTNET believes yield should feel dangerous. We're building a survival game where your money is always at risk, skill gives you an edge, and watching others lose is part of the thrill. Jack in, survive the scans, extract your gains—or watch it all burn.

---

## Purpose

### Problem Statement

**The fundamental problem:** Crypto yield products fail to engage users emotionally. Passive staking is financially productive but psychologically dead—you deposit, wait, and occasionally check numbers. There's no tension, no story, no reason to come back.

**The cost:**
- **User apathy:** Depositors become mercenaries who chase the highest APY with zero loyalty
- **No retention:** Without engagement, protocols lose users to the next shiny farm
- **Missed potential:** DeFi has all the ingredients for compelling games (real money, real risk, real-time outcomes) but delivers spreadsheets instead

**Current alternatives:**
- **Passive staking/farming:** Boring. Set-and-forget. No engagement loop.
- **Pure gambling (casinos):** No skill. Unsustainable. House always wins long-term.
- **Competitive gaming:** Requires constant attention. Exhausting. Most players get rekt by sweats.

**Why this persists:** Building engaging financial games is hard. You need real-time infrastructure (most chains are too slow), balanced economics (most tokenomics are ponzis), and compelling UX (most DeFi is ugly). Until now, the pieces weren't there.

### Why Now?

**MegaETH changes the game.** With 10ms block times and 100,000+ TPS, MegaETH enables experiences that feel like video games, not blockchain transactions. Real-time feeds, instant outcomes, sub-second typing games—none of this was possible on Ethereum L1 or traditional L2s with 2-12 second blocks.

**Crypto gaming is maturing.** The market has learned from the Ponzi games of 2021-2022. Users now demand burned liquidity (no rugs), deflationary tokenomics (sustainable economics), and real utility (not just speculation).

**Consumer crypto is the narrative.** The industry is shifting from infrastructure to applications. MegaETH is explicitly targeting "consumer crypto"—entertainment, gaming, social. GHOSTNET is positioned as flagship degen entertainment.

### What Happens If No One Builds This?

DeFi remains a sea of identical yield farms competing on APY numbers. Users continue treating protocols as commodities, hopping between them with zero engagement. The massive potential of "money as a game" stays unrealized, and crypto entertainment remains dominated by pure gambling with no skill component.

### Target Users

#### The Degen

- **Characteristics:** High risk tolerance, active on crypto Twitter, chases narratives, enjoys volatility
- **Context:** Looking for the next 10-100x, willing to lose it all for the thrill
- **Language:** "ape in," "send it," "WAGMI/NGMI," "rekt"
- **Current workflow:** Rotates between memecoins, leveraged perps, and whatever's hot this week
- **Tools used:** DEX aggregators, Telegram alpha groups, Twitter/X
- **Trigger:** Sees others winning big, FOMO kicks in, wants in on the action

#### The Yield Seeker

- **Characteristics:** Has meaningful capital ($10k+), wants returns without constant management
- **Context:** Busy with work/life, can't actively trade, but wants better than TradFi savings rates
- **Language:** "sustainable yield," "what's the APY," "is this safe"
- **Current workflow:** Parks money in established protocols (Aave, Lido), checks weekly
- **Tools used:** DeFiLlama, yield aggregators, portfolio trackers
- **Trigger:** Discovers a yield source that seems sustainable AND interesting

#### The Competitive Gamer

- **Characteristics:** Skilled at games, enjoys PvP, wants to prove superiority
- **Context:** Has gaming skills (typing speed, reaction time) they can monetize
- **Language:** "skill gap," "outplay," "get good"
- **Current workflow:** Plays competitive games (CSGO, League), interested in crypto but finds pure gambling unsatisfying
- **Tools used:** Discord, streaming platforms, leaderboards
- **Trigger:** Finds a game where skill actually matters and there's money on the line

#### The Voyeur

- **Characteristics:** Enjoys watching drama unfold, may or may not participate
- **Context:** Entertained by others' wins and losses, the feed is content
- **Language:** "lmao rekt," "oof," "that's brutal"
- **Current workflow:** Watches trading streams, follows whale wallets, enjoys liquidation porn
- **Tools used:** Twitter, whale alert bots, trading view streams
- **Trigger:** Discovers a live feed of financial carnage that's more entertaining than their current content

### Success Criteria

**User outcomes:**
- Players feel genuine tension before trace scans
- Mini-game performance creates measurable survival advantages
- The feed becomes appointment viewing—users check it like social media
- Players tell stories about their close calls and big wins

**Business outcomes:**
- **Daily Active Users (DAU):** 1,000+ within 30 days of launch
- **Total Value Locked (TVL):** $500k within 60 days
- **Token burn rate:** Net deflationary at $175k+ daily volume
- **Retention:** 40%+ of users active after 7 days
- **Session length:** Average 10+ minutes (not just deposit and leave)

**Definition of "done":**
Success means GHOSTNET becomes a verb. "I got ghosted" means you survived. "I got traced" means you lost. The game mechanics enter crypto vocabulary.

### Vision

If GHOSTNET succeeds completely:

- **The feed becomes crypto's ESPN:** People watch it for entertainment, not just their own positions
- **Skill-based DeFi becomes a category:** Other protocols copy the passive-core + active-boost model
- **MegaETH proves consumer crypto:** GHOSTNET demonstrates that real-time blockchain enables new product categories
- **Sustainable yield gaming exists:** No more choosing between boring (safe) and exciting (Ponzi)

**3-5 year picture:** GHOSTNET expands to multiple game modes, becomes a platform for financial entertainment, and demonstrates that "money games" can be both engaging AND economically sustainable.

### Non-Goals

- **Not a traditional DEX or AMM:** We don't compete with Uniswap. The DEX exists only for $DATA liquidity.
- **Not a passive staking protocol:** Even THE VAULT (safe tier) is designed for engagement through the feed and social features, not pure APY farming.
- **Not pay-to-win:** Buying more $DATA doesn't guarantee survival. Skill (mini-games) provides edges, not wealth.
- **Not a casino:** Pure RNG gambling is boring. Trace Evasion typing, Hack Runs, and Dead Pool predictions add skill dimensions.
- **Not targeting TradFi users:** We're not building for people who want "safe" crypto. This is for degens who understand and accept high risk.
- **Not multi-chain (initially):** MegaETH-native only. The real-time experience requires MegaETH's performance.

### Constraints

| Type | Constraint | Impact |
|------|------------|--------|
| **Regulatory** | High-risk financial product, gambling-adjacent mechanics | Must include clear risk warnings; may be restricted in certain jurisdictions; no fiat on-ramp |
| **Technical** | Requires MegaETH's real-time capabilities | Cannot deploy to slower chains without degraded UX; dependent on MegaETH stability |
| **Economic** | Must be deflationary at sustainable volumes | Burn mechanics must exceed emissions; requires careful tuning of death rates and fees |
| **Security** | Smart contracts hold user funds | Requires audits, burned liquidity (can't rug), and battle-tested patterns |
| **User** | Target audience is crypto-native | No hand-holding for Web2 users; assumes wallet familiarity |

## Terminology

| Term | Meaning | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Risk Levels** | The 5 tiers players choose (VAULT through BLACK ICE) | Primary documentation term |
| **Security Clearances** | In-game thematic name for risk levels | Used in UI copy for immersion |
| **Levels** | Shorthand for risk levels | Acceptable in context |

---

## System Overview

GHOSTNET is a real-time survival game built on MegaETH. Players stake $DATA tokens at one of five risk levels (THE VAULT through BLACK ICE), earn yield while connected, and face periodic "trace scans" that can wipe their position. When players die, their capital flows to survivors and burns forever—creating sustainable yield without inflation.

The experience centers on a live command center that streams every stake, death, and extraction across the network. Optional mini-games (Trace Evasion typing, Hack Runs, Dead Pool predictions) let skilled players reduce their death rate and multiply their yields.

## Experience Principles

**Our three words:** Tense, Addictive, Fair

**Emotional journey:**
- When users arrive, they feel: Curious, slightly intimidated by the terminal aesthetic, intrigued by the live feed of activity
- When users leave, they should feel: Engaged (planning their next session), informed (understand what happened), and whether they won or lost, feel it was fair

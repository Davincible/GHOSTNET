## Jack In. Don't Get Traced.

---

## The Seed

You're a hacker. You jack into a hostile network. You earn yield while you're inside. But every few hours, the system runs a **trace scan**—and if you get caught, you lose everything.

The deeper you go, the higher the risk, the bigger the rewards.

**When others die, you profit.**

That's the game. That's the network. That's GHOSTNET.

---

## Why This Exists

Traditional blockchains are slow. 2-12 second blocks. By the time your transaction confirms, the adrenaline is gone. The moment is lost in the mempool.

We built GHOSTNET on MegaETH because **speed is the product**.

Sub-millisecond finality. When you see someone get traced in the feed, it *just happened*. No waiting. No lag. When your position survives a scan, you feel it instantly. The relief is real. The dopamine hits different when it's real-time.

This is what crypto gaming should feel like. Not a spreadsheet. A video game where the money is real.

### The Two-Layer Design

**Layer 1: Passive Economic Core**

Most people don't want to play—they want to invest and get rich. The core game requires ZERO interaction after staking:
- Jack in at your chosen clearance
- Accumulate yield passively
- Survive automated trace scans (RNG death rolls)
- Extract whenever you want

Close your browser. Go to sleep. Come back richer (or traced). The network runs 24/7 without you.

**Layer 2: Active Boost Games**

Optional mini-games that provide significant edges for those who engage:
- **Trace Evasion** — Type fast, reduce your death probability (up to -35%)
- **Hack Runs** — Complete runs for yield multipliers (up to 3x)
- **Dead Pool** — Bet on network outcomes (and hedge your positions)
- **Daily Ops** — Consistent small boosts (compound advantage)
- **Crew Raids** — Coordinated team challenges (social layer)
- **PvP Duels** — Competitive typing for wagers (skill flex)

Active operators have a massive edge. Passive operators? They're gambling on pure luck.

Your choice. Both work. Both can win. Both can lose.

---

## The Vocabulary

Before we go deeper, learn the language. This is how operators talk.

```
GHOSTNET DICTIONARY
───────────────────

Jack In     = Deposit/stake (you're entering the network)
Extract     = Withdraw (you're pulling your gains out)
Ghost       = Survived a scan (you're still alive)
Traced      = Died/liquidated (network caught you)
Operator    = Player (you)
The Feed    = Live activity stream (the dopamine engine)
Trace Scan  = Death roll event (the moment of truth)
Ghost Streak = Consecutive survivals (flex it)
The Cascade = Redistribution system (how deaths feed survivors)
The Furnace = Burn mechanism (tokens going to 0xdead)
$DATA       = The token (always with the $)
```

We don't say "users." We say **operators**.
We don't say "deposit." We say **jack in**.
We don't say "withdraw." We say **extract**.

You're not using a protocol. You're entering a network. Act like it.

╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Here's the game theory: **Dead capital flows UP**.

When someone in BLACK ICE gets traced, their stake doesn't vanish. It flows upward—to DARKNET, SUBNET, MAINFRAME, and THE VAULT. Degens feed whales. That's the design.

Want safe yield? Park in THE VAULT and let the degens below fund your returns.

Want massive gains? Jack into BLACK ICE and pray. 90% death rate. But if you survive... you eat everyone else's stack.

### The Network Effect (It Gets Safer)

Here's the part most people miss: **more players = lower death rates for everyone.**

```
NETWORK MODIFIER
────────────────

TVL < $100k:      Death rates x1.2   (early = dangerous)
TVL $100k-$500k:  Death rates x1.0   (normal)
TVL $500k-$1M:    Death rates x0.9   (getting safer)
TVL > $1M:        Death rates x0.85  (network strength bonus)
```

When you see whale alerts in the feed—when big deposits land—your death rate actually *decreases*. The network rewards growth. Watch someone jack in with 10,000 $DATA? Your odds just got better.

This is positive-sum game theory. The bigger the network, the safer everyone is. But there's still always death. Just... less of it.

---

## The Three Threats

Once you're in, you face three ways to die. Surviving all of them is how you win.

### Threat 1: THE TRACE SCAN

The main event. The moment of truth. The RNG death roll.

At the end of every scan period (30 mins for BLACK ICE, up to 24 hours for MAINFRAME), the network rolls a random number for every position. If you're selected, you get **traced**. Your stake is seized. Redistributed. Gone.

If you survive, you keep your **ghost status**. You keep earning. And you get a cut of everyone who just died.

```
TRACE SCAN SEQUENCE
───────────────────

1. Warning hits the feed (60 seconds out)
   > ⚠ TRACE SCAN [DARKNET] in 00:60 ⚠

2. Countdown escalates (final seconds)
   > ⚠ TRACE SCAN [DARKNET] IMMINENT ⚠

3. The scan executes
   > ░░░░░ SCANNING DARKNET ░░░░░

4. Results stream live
   > 0x7a3f survived [DARKNET] 👻
   > 0x9c2d ████ TRACED ████ 💀
   > 0x3b1a survived [DARKNET] 👻
   > 0x8f2e ████ TRACED ████ 💀

5. Summary drops
   > SCAN COMPLETE: 847 ghosts, 153 traced
   > CASCADE INITIATED: 12,400 $DATA redistributed
```

That's the game. Every scan. Every level. Every time.

The feed will show you who lived and who died. In real-time. No delay. This is why we built on MegaETH.

### Threat 2: THE SYSTEM RESET

A global timer that keeps the network hungry.

Every time someone jacks in, the timer resets. Big deposits reset it more. If no one deposits and the timer hits zero? **Catastrophic collapse.** Everyone loses a chunk of their stake.

```
TIMER RESET VALUES
──────────────────

< 50 $DATA:      +1 hour
50-200 $DATA:    +4 hours
200-500 $DATA:   +8 hours
500-1000 $DATA:  +16 hours
> 1000 $DATA:    Full reset (24 hours)
```

The last person to deposit before collapse? They win the **jackpot**—50% of the penalty pool. 

This creates urgency. This creates content. This creates "SOMEONE SAVE THE NETWORK" moments. The timer is always ticking. The feed is always watching.

### Threat 3: THE CULLING

Each level has a capacity limit. When a level is full and someone new wants in, they don't get blocked. Instead, someone in the bottom 50% of stakes gets **culled**.

Lower stake = higher chance of getting kicked out.

The culled operator loses 80% of their stake (redistributed), gets 20% back as "severance."

This means: **maintain a competitive stake size or risk getting replaced.**

Your dashboard shows your "Culling Risk %" at all times. Watch it. If it's high, jack in more—or move to a level where you're safer.

---

## The Cascade

This is the economic engine. This is how yield actually works. This is why GHOSTNET isn't a ponzi.

When someone gets traced, their stake doesn't go to the devs. It doesn't vanish. It cascades:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                    THE CASCADE: 60/30/10 RULE                     ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║                                                                   ║
║  TRACED POSITION: 100 $DATA                                       ║

║  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ ║
║  │ 60% → REWARD POOL (60 $DATA)                                │ ║
║  │   └── 30 goes to survivors in your level (jackpot)          │ ║
║  │   └── 30 flows UPWARD to safer levels (yield)               │ ║
║  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ ║
║                                                                   ║
║  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ ║
║  │ 30% → BURNED FOREVER (30 $DATA) 🔥                          │ ║
║  │   └── Sent to 0xdead. Never coming back.                    │ ║
║  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ ║
║                                                                   ║
║  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ ║
║  │ 10% → PROTOCOL (10 $DATA)                                   │ ║
║  │   └── Operations, development, we gotta eat too             │ ║
║  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ ║
║                                                                   ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Read that again. **30% of every death is burned.**

Not redistributed. Not paid out. **Burned.** Sent to a dead address. Removed from existence forever.

This is why the tokenomics work. This is why we're not a ponzi. Deaths reduce supply. More activity = more burns = deflationary pressure. The furnace never stops.

### The Upward Flow

Capital flows UP the clearance ladder:

```
BLACK ICE deaths    → Feeds DARKNET, SUBNET, MAINFRAME, VAULT
DARKNET deaths      → Feeds SUBNET, MAINFRAME, VAULT
SUBNET deaths       → Feeds MAINFRAME, VAULT
MAINFRAME deaths    → Feeds VAULT
VAULT deaths        → N/A (0% death rate, remember?)
```

The safe levels eat the risky levels. That's the design. That's why it's sustainable. Whales don't need new money to make yield—they need degens to keep dying.

And trust us. Degens keep dying.

## The Feed

The dopamine engine. The content machine. The reason you'll check GHOSTNET 47 times a day.

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Every jack-in. Every extraction. Every death. Every survival. Every whale. Every crew achievement. Every close call.

All of it. Real-time. No delay.

When you see `████ TRACED ████`—that operator just lost their stack. Just now. Not a minute ago. Just now. And part of their money just flowed to you.

You'll watch this for hours. We're not sorry.

### Feed Event Types

| Event | What It Means | Your Reaction |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| Jack In | New operator entered | More TVL, your death rate drops slightly |
| Extraction | Someone cashed out | They're out, one less competitor |
| **TRACED** | Someone died | 💀 RIP to them, money to you |
| Survived | Someone made it | 👻 Ghost status maintained |
| Scan Warning | Death roll coming | 😰 Clench time |
| Whale Alert | Big deposit | 🐋 Timer reset, everyone safer |
| Crew Event | Team achievement | ⚡ Coordination pays off |
| Jackpot | Rare survival | 🔥 Legend status |

The traced feed the living. That's the way.

## The Burn Engines

Five ways $DATA gets destroyed. This is how we stay deflationary.

### Engine 1: The Death Tax

30% of every traced position is burned. Not redistributed. **Burned.**

Someone dies with 1,000 $DATA? 300 $DATA goes to 0xdead. Forever.

### Engine 2: The ETH Toll Booth

Every protocol interaction costs $2.00 in ETH.

- Jack in? $2.
- Extract? $2.
- Claim rewards? $2.
- Enter a mini-game? $2.

90% of that fee ($1.80) automatically buys $DATA on the DEX and burns it. Instant. Automatic. Every transaction.

### Engine 3: The Trading Tax

10% tax on every DEX trade. 9% of that is burned.

Panic selling? You're burning supply.
Buying the dip? You're burning supply.
Every trade burns.

### Engine 4: The Dead Pool Rake

5% of every betting pot in the prediction market is burned.

More bets = more burns.

### Engine 5: Consumables

Items in the Black Market are 100% burned:

| Item | Cost (Burned) | Effect |
|------|---------------|--------|
| Stimpack | 50 $DATA | +25% yield for 4h |
| EMP | 100 $DATA | Pause your timer 1h |
| Ghost Protocol | 200 $DATA | Skip one trace scan |
| Exploit Kit | 75 $DATA | Unlock hack run paths |
| ICE Breaker | 150 $DATA | -10% trace rate 24h |

Want an edge? Pay for it. The tokens get burned.

### The Math

```
AT $100,000 DAILY VOLUME:

Game Deaths:        ~9,000 $DATA burned
ETH Toll Buybacks:  ~3,600 $DATA burned  
Trading Tax:        ~4,500 $DATA burned
Dead Pool Rake:     ~500 $DATA burned
Consumables:        ~1,000 $DATA burned
────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL DAILY BURN:   ~18,600 $DATA

vs. Daily Emission: ~82,000 $DATA

BREAK-EVEN: ~$175,000 daily volume

Above that? NET DEFLATION. Supply shrinks every day.
```

The furnace never stops. The supply only goes down.

### The Flywheel (Why Burns Work Either Way)

Here's the beautiful thing about multi-engine burns:

```
IF TOKEN PRICE DUMPS:
├── Trading tax (9%) burns more supply per dollar traded
├── Panic selling = accelerated burns
├── Lower price = more tokens burned per $1 of fees
└── Creates natural price floor through supply destruction

IF TOKEN PRICE PUMPS:
├── More dollar value flowing through game
├── Higher ETH fees ($2 fixed) buy more tokens
├── Attracts more players = more game volume = more burns
└── Creates positive flywheel

IF GAME ACTIVITY DROPS:
├── System reset timer accelerates toward zero
├── Jackpot incentive increases (be the hero who saves the network)
├── Fear of collapse drives new deposits
└── Self-correcting mechanism
```

The system punishes inaction more than any market direction. Dumps burn. Pumps burn. Activity burns. The only thing that doesn't burn is... nothing. And nothing triggers system collapse.

We engineered this to be anti-fragile. Stress makes it stronger.

## The Mini-Games

The passive game is pure luck. The active game gives you an edge. Here's how operators reduce their death rate.

### Trace Evasion (Typing Challenge)

Type hacker commands to scramble your trace signature. The faster and more accurate you type, the harder you are to trace.

Commands from the library look like real hacking:
```
ssh -L 8080:localhost:443 ghost@proxy.darknet.io
nmap -sS -sV -p- --script vuln target.subnet
curl -X POST -H 'Auth: Bearer token' https://api.ghost/extract
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in data.bin -out cipher.enc
msfconsole -q -x 'use exploit/multi/handler; set PAYLOAD'
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 0.0.0.0/0 -j DROP && ghost --activate
```

**Rewards:**

| Performance | Death Rate Reduction |
|-------------|----------------------|
| 50-69% accuracy | -5% |
| 70-84% accuracy | -10% |
| 85-94% accuracy | -15% |
| 95-99% accuracy | -20% |
| 100% perfect | -25% |
| Speed bonus (>80 WPM + 95% acc) | Additional -5% |
| Speed bonus (>100 WPM + 95% acc) | Additional -10% |

**Maximum reduction: -35% death rate.** Active operators have a massive edge.

### Hack Runs (Yield Multiplier)

Pay an entry fee. Navigate through 5 nodes. Make decisions at each one. Type the commands. Survive, and you get a yield multiplier.

```
START ──▶ FIREWALL ──▶ PATROL ──▶ DATA CACHE ──▶ TRAP ──▶ ICE WALL ──▶ EXTRACT
              │           │           │          │           │
           [Medium]    [Easy]     [High]    [V.High]    [V.Hard]
```

Each node gives you choices. Harder paths = better rewards. Easier paths = safer but less payout.

| Run Result | Multiplier | Duration |
|------------|------------|----------|
| Failed (died) | None, lose entry fee | - |
| Survived 3/5 | 1.25x yield | 4 hours |
| Survived 4/5 | 1.5x yield | 4 hours |
| Survived 5/5 | 2x yield | 4 hours |
| Perfect (no damage) | 3x yield | 4 hours |

Entry fee: 50-200 $DATA. High risk, high reward. Just like everything else.

### Dead Pool (Prediction Market)

Bet on network outcomes. Pure degenerate gambling on top of the degenerate game.

```
THE QUESTION:
"How many operators will be TRACED in the next BLACK ICE scan?"

[UNDER 50]              [OVER 50]
Pool: 12,400 $DATA      Pool: 8,200 $DATA
Payout: 1.66x           Payout: 2.51x
```

**Round types:**
- Death Count: Over/under on deaths
- Whale Watch: Will a 1000+ $DATA position die?
- Survival Streak: Will anyone hit 10+ streak?
- System Reset: Will timer hit critical?

5% rake on every pot goes to the furnace. More gambling = more burns.

### The Hedge Play

Smart operators use Dead Pool to reduce variance. Here's the math:

```
THE HEDGE CALCULATOR
────────────────────

Your position: BLACK ICE, 100 $DATA
Your death rate: 85%
Expected outcome: Lose 100 $DATA (85% of the time)

HEDGE STRATEGY: Bet 30 $DATA on "HIGH DEATHS" (OVER)

Scenario 1: You survive (15%)
├── Keep 100 $DATA position + yield
├── Lose 30 $DATA bet (deaths were probably high)
└── Net: +70 $DATA position

Scenario 2: You get traced (85%)
├── Lose 100 $DATA position
├── Win ~60 $DATA from bet (2x on your 30)
└── Net: -40 $DATA (reduced from -100)

HEDGE REDUCES YOUR VARIANCE BY 60%
```

This is degenerate game theory at its finest. You can't eliminate risk—but you can shape it. The Dead Pool isn't just gambling on others. It's risk management for yourself.

### Daily Ops

Quick daily tasks for consistent bonuses:

```
✓ SIGNAL CHECK      Complete 1 typing challenge    → +5% yield
○ NETWORK PATROL    Check in 3 times today         → -3% death
○ DATA PACKET       Claim daily $DATA              → 10 $DATA free
○ CREW SYNC         3 crew members complete        → +10% crew bonus
○ STREAK KEEPER     7 days straight                → 100 $DATA bonus
```

Show up every day. Stack small edges. They add up.

### PvP Duels

Challenge another operator. Both wager. Both type. Winner takes 90%. 10% burned.

```
YOU (0x7a3f)                VS                OPPONENT (0x9c2d)
████████████████░░░░░░ 42%                   ██████████████░░░░░░░░ 38%
WPM: 78    ACC: 96%                          WPM: 71    ACC: 94%

WAGER: 50 $DATA each | Winner takes 90 $DATA | 10 $DATA burned
```

Think you're fast? Prove it. Put money on it.

Completion unlocks 2x yield for ALL crew members for 24 hours. Fail, and you get nothing. The crew either wins together or loses together.

This is where the Discord pings fly. This is where alliances form. This is where GHOSTNET becomes social.

Find your people. Coordinate. Win together.

## The Dopamine Stack

We designed every element to hit different:

**ANTICIPATION**
- Countdown timers everywhere
- "Next scan in..." creates tension
- System reset timer = shared anxiety
- Watching the feed for deaths/wins

**VARIABLE REWARDS**
- Death is probabilistic (never certain)
- Typing performance affects outcomes
- Big wins are rare but visible
- Jackpot moments in the feed

**SOCIAL PROOF**
- See others winning in real-time
- See others dying (scarcity mindset)
- Whale alerts create FOMO
- Crew achievements visible to all

**NEAR MISSES**
- "You survived at 32% death rate!"
- Streaks that almost continue
- Almost perfect typing scores
- Almost beating someone in PvP

**LOSS AVERSION**
- Can see exactly what you'd lose
- Stake visible at all times
- Deaths of similar positions highlighted
- "This could be you" energy

**PROGRESS**
- Yield accumulating in real-time (watch the number climb)
- Ghost streak counter (flex your survival runs)
- Daily ops completion (daily dopamine hits)
- Leaderboard climbing (competitive juice)

You'll check the feed compulsively. You'll feel the scan countdowns. You'll celebrate survivals and mourn deaths (while pocketing the cascade).

That's by design. We're not sorry.

### Streamable Moments

GHOSTNET is designed to be watched. Here's what makes content:

**High Tension:**
- Trace scan countdown (final 10 seconds)
- Survival at high death rate ("I SURVIVED 90%!")
- System reset close calls ("THE TIMER IS AT 30 SECONDS")
- Typing challenge under pressure

**Big Wins:**
- Perfect hack runs (all 5 nodes, no damage, 3x multiplier)
- Jackpot survivals in BLACK ICE
- PvP duel victories with trash talk
- Massive whale extractions

**Social:**
- Crew raid coordination in Discord
- PvP tournament brackets
- Chat reactions when someone gets traced
- Alliance/rivalry drama between crews

**Strategy:**
- Optimal level selection breakdowns
- Typing technique tutorials (WPM optimization)
- Hack run path optimization
- Hedging strategies explained

This isn't just a game. It's content. Watch parties during scan countdowns. Stream highlights of close calls. Clip compilations of deaths and survivals. We built for the timeline.

## The Visual Language

Terminal aesthetics. Hacker fantasy. Casino mechanics.

**Colors:**
```css
--green-bright: #00ff00;    /* Primary - the matrix green */
--green-glow: rgba(0,255,0,0.3);
--red: #ff0000;             /* Deaths, danger, losses */
--gold: #ffd700;            /* Jackpots, big wins */
--cyan: #00ffff;            /* Info, links, interactive */
--amber: #ffaa00;           /* Warnings */
```

**Typography:** IBM Plex Mono. Monospace everything. We're hackers, not bankers.

**Effects:**
- CRT scanlines (subtle, constant)
- Screen flicker (8-second cycle)
- Death flash (red pulse when someone gets traced)
- Jackpot glow (gold particles on big wins)
- Text glow on important numbers

**Sound:** ZzFX synthesized sounds. Beeps for connections. Chimes for survivals. Alarms for deaths. Fanfares for jackpots.

When you see `████ TRACED ████`, your screen should flash red for a split second. That's someone's money becoming your money. Feel it.

Read that liquidity line again. **BURNED.** Not locked. Burned. The LP tokens are sent to 0xdead at launch. They don't exist anymore. We cannot withdraw them. Ever.

We're stuck here with you.

**Emission:**

```
Daily emission from THE MINE: ~82,000 $DATA

├── VAULT:     5%
├── MAINFRAME: 10%

└── BLACK ICE: 35%

Higher risk = bigger share of emissions.
```

## Why GHOSTNET Wins

| The Problem | Our Answer |
|-------------|------------|
| "Crypto games are boring" | Real-time feed of wins and losses. Pure dopamine. |
| "I have to play constantly" | 100% passive option. Jack in and forget. |
| "Devs always rug" | Liquidity is **BURNED**. We literally can't. |
| "Tokenomics are ponzi" | 30% of every death burns. Deflationary by design. |
| "No skill in gambling" | Mini-games give -35% death rate to skilled operators. |
| "L2s are slow" | MegaETH. 10ms blocks. Feels like a video game. |

We're not the first survival game. We're not the first DeFi game. We're not the first thing on MegaETH.

But we're the first to combine all of it into something that actually feels good to play. Real-time. Real risk. Real rewards.

---

## Who Should Jack In

### The Degen
You know who you are. High risk tolerance. CT native. Chasing the next 10x. You'll live in BLACK ICE. You'll lose sometimes. You'll win sometimes. You'll tell everyone about both.

### The Yield Seeker
You have capital. You want returns. You don't want to babysit positions. Jack into THE VAULT or MAINFRAME. Let the degens below fund your yield. Check back weekly. Sleep at night.

### The Competitive Gamer
You're fast. You want to prove it. The typing games are for you. Reduce your death rate through pure skill. Climb the leaderboards. Flex your ghost streak.

### The Voyeur
You might not even play. But you'll watch the feed for hours. Deaths, survivals, whale alerts, close calls. It's content. It's entertainment. It's free.

---

## What This Isn't

Let's be clear about what we're NOT:

- **Not a DEX.** The swap exists for $DATA liquidity. That's it.
- **Not passive staking.** Even THE VAULT is designed for engagement through the feed.
- **Not pay-to-win.** Money doesn't buy survival. Skill does.
- **Not a casino.** Pure RNG is boring. Typing games add skill layers.
- **Not for normies.** This is for degens who understand and accept risk.
- **Not multi-chain.** MegaETH only. The experience requires real-time.

## Network Health

How do you know if GHOSTNET is thriving? Watch these numbers:

```
HEALTHY NETWORK INDICATORS
──────────────────────────

TVL:               > $500k (network strength bonus active)
Daily Volume:      > $175k (net deflationary)
System Timer:      > 4 hours (comfortable margin)
Burn Rate:         > 82k $DATA/day (outpacing emissions)
DAU/MAU Ratio:     > 30% (sticky users)
Mini-game Rate:    > 40% of operators engaging (skill layer working)
Crew Participation: > 60% of operators in crews (social layer working)
```

When these metrics are green, the flywheel is spinning. When they're red, opportunity knocks—the jackpot incentives increase, the hero rewards get bigger.

The network tells you its health in real-time. Watch the feed. Read the vitals. Adapt your strategy.

---

## The Network Is Live

The feed is burning. Operators are jacking in. Scans are running. The cascade is flowing. The furnace is hungry.

The only question is: **are you brave enough?**

Jack in. Don't get traced.

*Play fast. Die young. Or don't die at all.*

# Lessons Learned

This directory captures lessons learned from difficult problems encountered during development.

## Purpose

When we encounter and solve sticky issues (3+ attempts to fix), we document:
- What the problem was
- What we tried that didn't work
- What ultimately solved it
- Why the solution works

This prevents re-learning the same lessons.
